### 🎯 Here's the Deal

By day, I'm grinding through my **Master of Business Analytics at Deakin**. By evening, I'm working part-time. By night? I'm teaching myself to turn messy data into "aha!" moments.

**The Goal:** Become the person who walks into a room full of confused executives and developers, listens to both, and says *"Here's what the data actually says, and here's what we should do about it."*

Because honestly? The world doesn't need more people who can just run code. It needs people who can make data make sense to everyone in the room.

### 🔥 Why I'm Different

Most people learn data analysis to get a job. I'm learning it to **get out of labor work** and **help others do the same.**

Real talk:
- 💪 I'm funding my own master's degree
- 📚 I study full-time while working part-time
- 🚀 I'm building this portfolio from scratch because I believe in showing, not telling
- 🎯 My endgame? Not just landing a good job—creating opportunities for others

**Translation:** I know what hard work looks like. I know what it means to hustle. And I know how to get things done when the odds aren't in your favor.

### 🛠️ What's in My Toolkit

**Languages I Speak:**
- Python (fluent enough to make pandas do my bidding 🐼)
- SQL (for when I need to have serious conversations with databases)
- Excel (yes, it counts, and yes, I can make it sing)

**Tools I Love:**
- Pandas & NumPy (data wrangling warriors)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (because ugly charts hurt my soul)
- Jupyter Notebooks (my creative playground)
- Git & GitHub (you're looking at it!)

**Currently Leveling Up:**
- Tableau & Power BI (making data sexy)
- Statistical Analysis (beyond "this number is bigger")
- Machine Learning basics (teaching computers to be smart)

### 🎨 My Approach (a.k.a. How I Actually Work)
```
1. Listen First → What problem are we REALLY solving?
2. Get Curious → What does the data whisper when nobody's looking?
3. Analyze Smart → Not every question needs machine learning
4. Visualize Clear → Your grandma should understand this chart
5. Recommend Bold → "Here's what we should do" not "here are some options maybe"
```

I don't do analysis for analysis sake. Every project needs to answer: **"So what should we do differently?"**

### 🌟 What Makes Me, Me

**What Drives Me:**
- 🔥 That moment when complex data suddenly makes perfect sense
- 💡 Helping people make better decisions with information
- 🎯 Proving that your background doesn't define your future
- 🚀 Building something from nothing (this portfolio is proof)

**What You Won't Find Here:**
- ❌ Perfect polished projects (yet—I'm building in public)
- ❌ Pretending I know everything
- ❌ Boring corporate speak

**What You WILL Find:**
- ✅ Real work solving real problems
- ✅ Honest progress over fake perfection
- ✅ Someone who actually cares about the "why" behind the data

### 📈 The Journey So Far
```
Started: "What even is pandas? 🤔"
Now: "Let me clean that dataset for you 💪"
Next: "Here's the dashboard with the answer you need 📊"
Soon: "Let me teach you how to do this yourself 🎓"
```

### 💭 My Philosophy on Data

> *"Anyone can calculate an average. The magic is knowing which average to calculate and why it matters."*

> *"If your stakeholder needs a statistics degree to understand your analysis, you've failed."*

> *"Data doesn't lie, but it doesn't always tell the whole truth either. Our job is to ask better questions."*
